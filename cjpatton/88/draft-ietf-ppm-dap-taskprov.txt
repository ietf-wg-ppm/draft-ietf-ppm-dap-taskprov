             Task Binding and In-Band Provisioning for DAP
                   draft-ietf-ppm-dap-taskprov-latest

Abstract

   An extension for the Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) is
   specified that cryptographically binds the parameters of a task to
   the task's execution.  In particular, when a client includes this
   extension with its report, the servers will only aggregate the report
   if all parties agree on the task parameters.  This document also
   specifies an optional mechanism for in-band task provisioning that
   builds on the report extension.

1.  Introduction

   (RFC EDITOR: Remove this paragraph.)  This draft is maintained in
   https://github.com/ietf-wg-ppm/draft-ietf-ppm-dap-taskprov.

   The DAP protocol [DAP] enables secure aggregation of a set of reports
   submitted by Clients.  This process is centered around a "task" that
   determines, among other things, the cryptographic scheme to use for
   the secure computation (a Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Function
   [VDAF]), how reports are partitioned into batches, and privacy
   parameters such as the minimum size of each batch.  See Section 4.2
   of [DAP] for a complete listing.

   In order to execute a task securely, it is required that all parties
   agree on all parameters associated with the task.  However, the core
   DAP specification does not specify a mechanism for accomplishing
   this.  In particular, it is possible that the parties successfully
   aggregate and collect a batch, but some party does not know the
   parameters that were enforced.

   A desirable property for DAP to guarantee is that successful
   execution implies agreement on the task parameters.  On the other
   hand, disagreement between a Client and the Aggregators should
   prevent reports uploaded by that Client from being processed.

   Section 3 specifies a report extension (Section 4.4.3 of [DAP]) that
   endows DAP with this property.  First, it specifies an encoding of
   all task parameters that are relevant to all parties.  This excludes
   cryptographic assets, such as the secret VDAF verification key
   (Section 5 of [VDAF]) or the public HPKE configurations [RFC9180] of
   the aggregators or collector.  Second, the task ID is computed by
   hashing the encoded parameters.  If a report includes the extension,
   then each aggregator checks if the task ID was computed properly: if
   not, it rejects the report.  This cryptographic binding of the task
   to its parameters ensures that the report is only processed if the
   client and aggregator agree on the task parameters.

   One reason this task-binding property is desirable is that it makes
   the process by which parties are provisioned with task parameters
   more robust.  This is because misconfiguration of a party would
   manifest in a server's telemetry as report rejection.  This is
   preferable to failing silently, as misconfiguration could result in
   privacy loss.

   Section 4 specifies one possible mechanism for provisioning DAP tasks
   that is built on top of the extension in Section 3.  Its chief design
   goal is to make task configuration completely in-band, via HTTP
   request headers.  Note that this mechanism is an optional feature of
   this specification; it is not required to implement the protocol
   extension in Section 3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the same conventions for error handling as [DAP].
   In addition, this document extends the core specification by adding
   the following error types:

       +=============+============================================+
       | Type        | Description                                |
       +=============+============================================+
       | invalidTask | An Aggregator has opted out of the         |
       |             | indicated task as described in Section 4.4 |
       +-------------+--------------------------------------------+

                                 Table 1

   The terms used follow those described in [DAP].  The following new
   terms are used:

   Task configuration:  The non-secret parameters of a task.

   Task author:  The entity that defines a task's configuration in the
      provisioning mechanism of Section 4.

3.  The Taskbind Extension

   To use the Taskbind extension, the Client includes the following
   extension in the report extensions for each Aggregator as described
   in Section 4.4.3 of [DAP]:

   enum {
       taskbind(0xff00),
       (2^16-1)
   } ExtensionType;

   The payload of the extension MUST be empty.  If the payload is non-
   empty, then the Aggregator MUST reject the report.

   When the client uses the Taskbind extension, it computes the task ID
   (Section 4.2 of [DAP]) as follows:

   task_id = SHA-256(SHA-256("dap-taskprov task id") || task_config)

   where task_config is a TaskConfig structure defined in Section 3.1.
   Function SHA-256() is as defined in [SHS].

   The task ID is bound to each report share (via HPKE authenticated and
   associated data, see Section 4.4.2 of [DAP]).  Binding the parameters
   to the ID this way ensures, in turn, that the report is only
   aggregated if the Client and Aggregator agree on the parameters.
   This is accomplished by the Aggregator behavior below.

   During aggregation (Section 4.5 of [DAP]), each Aggregator processes
   a report with the Taskbind extension as follows.

   First, it looks up the ID and parameters associated with the task.
   Note the task has already been configured; otherwise the Aggregator
   would have already aborted the request due to not recognizing the
   task.

   Next, the Aggregator encodes the parameters as a TaskConfig defined
   in Section 3.1 and computes the task ID as above.  If the derived
   task ID does not match the task ID of the request, then it MUST
   reject the report with error "invalid_message".

   During the upload flow (Section 4.4 of [DAP]), the Leader SHOULD
   abort the request with "unrecognizedTask" if the derived task ID does
   not match the task ID of the request.

3.1.  Task Encoding

   The task configuration is encoded as follows:

   struct {
       /* Info specific for a task. */
       opaque task_info<1..2^8-1>;

       /* Leader API endpoint. */
       Url leader_aggregator_endpoint;

       /* Helper API endpoint. */
       Url helper_aggregator_endpoint;

       /* Time precision. */
       Duration time_precision;

       /* Minimum batch size. */
       uint32 min_batch_size;

       /* The batch mode and its parameters. */
       opaque batch_config<1..2^16-1>;

       /* The earliest timestamp that will be accepted for this task. */
          task. */
       Time task_start;

       /* The duration of the task. */
       Duration task_duration;

       /* Determines the VDAF type and its config parameters. */
       opaque vdaf_config<1..2^16-1>;

       /* Taskbind Extensions. */
       TaskbindExtension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
   } TaskConfig;

   The purpose of TaskConfig is to define all parameters that are
   necessary for configuring each party.  It includes all parameters
   listed in Section 4.3 of [DAP] as well as two additional fields:

   *  task_info is an opaque field whose contents are specific to the
      deployment.  For example, this might be a human-readable string
      describing the purpose of this task.

   *  extensions is a list of extensions to this document.  The format
      and semantics of extensions are describe in Section 3.2.

   This structure does not include cryptographic assets shared by only a
   subset of the parties, including the secret VDAF verification key
   [VDAF] or public HPKE configurations [RFC9180].

   The batch_config field defines the DAP batch mode.  Its contents are
   as follows:

   struct {
       BatchMode batch_mode;
       select (BatchMode.batch_mode) {
           case time_interval:   Empty;
           case leader_selected: Empty;
       };
   } BatchConfig;

   The length prefix of the query_config ensures that the QueryConfig
   structure can be decoded even if an unrecognized variant is
   encountered (i.e., an unimplemented query type).

   The vdaf_config defines the configuration of the VDAF in use for this
   task.  Its content is as follows (codepoints are as defined in
   Section 10 of [VDAF]):

   enum {
       reserved(0x00000000),
       prio3_count(0x00000001),
       prio3_sum(0x00000002),
       prio3_sum_vec(0x00000003),
       prio3_histogram(0x00000004),
       prio3_multihot_count_vec(0x00000005),
       poplar1(0x00000006),
       (2^32-1)
   } VdafType;

   struct {
       VdafType vdaf_type;
       select (VdafConfig.vdaf_type) {
           case prio3_count:
               Empty;
           case prio3_sum:
               uint8;  /* bit length of the summand */
           case prio3_sum_vec:
               uint32; /* length of the vector */
               uint8;  /* bit length of each summand */
               uint32; /* size of each proof chunk */
           case prio3_histogram:
               uint32; /* number of buckets */
               uint32; /* size of each proof chunk */
           case poplar1:
               uint16; /* bit length of input string */
       };
   } VdafConfig;

   The length prefix of the vdaf_config ensures that the VdafConfig
   structure can be decoded even if an unrecognized variant is
   encountered (i.e., an unimplemented VDAF).

   The definition of Time, Duration, Url, and BatchMode follow those in
   [DAP].

3.2.  Extensions

   The TaskConfig structure includes a list of extensions.  In general,
   extensions can be used to bind additional, application-specific
   information to the task.  For example, an extension might be used to
   encode the identity of the Collector.  (Only the Aggregators are
   identified in TaskConfig.)

   Each extension is structured as follows:

   struct {
     TaskbindExtensionType extension_type;
     opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
   } TaskbindExtension;

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     (2^16-1)
   } TaskbindExtensionType;

   The extension_type identifies the extension and extension_data is
   structured as specified by the extension.

   Extensions are treated as mandatory-to-implement in the protocol
   described in Section 4.  In particular protocols participants MUST
   opt-out of tasks containing unrecognized extensions.  See
   Section 4.4.

   Note that Taskind extensions are semantically distinct from DAP
   report extensions and do not share the same codepoint registry
   (Section 7.2).  Future documents may want to define both a Taskbind
   extension and a report extension, but there may also be situations
   where a document defines one but not the other.

4.  In-band Task Provisioning with the Taskbind Extension

   Before a task can be executed, it is necessary to first provision the
   Clients, Aggregators, and Collector with the task's configuration.
   The core DAP specification does not define a mechanism for
   provisioning tasks.  This section describes a mechanism whose key
   feature is that task configuration is performed completely in-band,
   via HTTP request headers.

   This method presumes the existence of a logical "task author"
   (written as "Author" hereafter) who is capable of pushing
   configurations to Clients.  All parameters required by downstream
   entities (the Aggregators) are carried by HTTP headers piggy-backed
   on the protocol flow.

   This mechanism is designed with the same security and privacy
   considerations of the core DAP protocol.  The Author is not regarded
   as a trusted third party: it is incumbent on all protocol
   participants to verify the task configuration disseminated by the
   Author and opt-out if the parameters are deemed insufficient for
   privacy.  In particular, adopters of this mechanism should presume
   the Author is under the adversary's control.  In fact, we expect in a
   real-world deployment that the Author may be co-located with the
   Collector.

   The DAP protocol also requires configuring the entities with a
   variety of assets that are not task-specific, but are important for
   establishing Client-Aggregator, Collector-Aggregator, and Aggregator-
   Aggregator relationships.  These include:

   *  The Collector's HPKE [RFC9180] configuration used by the
      Aggregators to encrypt aggregate shares.

   *  Any assets required for authenticating HTTP requests.

   This section does not specify a mechanism for provisioning these
   assets; as in the core DAP protocol; these are presumed to be
   configured out-of-band.

   Note that we consider the VDAF verification key [VDAF], used by the
   Aggregators to aggregate reports, to be a task-specific asset.  This
   document specifies how to derive this key for a given task from a
   pre-shared secret, which in turn is presumed to be configured out-of-
   band.

4.1.  Overview

   The process of provisioning a task begins when the Author
   disseminates the task configuration to the Collector and each of the
   Clients.  When a Client issues an upload request to the Leader (as
   described in Section 4.3 of [DAP]), it includes in an HTTP header the
   task configuration it used to generate the report.  We refer to this
   process as "task advertisement".  Before consuming the report, the
   Leader parses the configuration and decides whether to opt-in; if
   not, the task's execution halts.

   Otherwise, if the Leader does opt-in, it advertises the task to the
   Helper during the aggregation protocol (Section 4.4 of [DAP]).  In
   particular, it includes the task configuration in an HTTP header of
   each aggregation job request for that task.  Before proceeding, the
   Helper must first parse the configuration and decide whether to opt-
   in; if not, the task's execution halts.

4.2.  Task Advertisement

   To advertise a task to its peer, a protocol participant includes a
   header "dap-taskprov" with a request incident to the task execution.
   The value is the TaskConfig structure defined Section 3.1, expanded
   into its URL-safe, unpadded Base 64 representation as specified in
   Sections 5 and 3.2 of [RFC4648].

4.3.  Deriving the VDAF Verification Key

   When a Leader and Helper implement this mechanism, they SHOULD
   compute the shared VDAF verification key [VDAF] as described in this
   section.

   The Aggregators are presumed to have securely exchanged a pre-shared
   secret out-of-band.  The length of this secret MUST be 32 bytes.  Let
   us denote this secret by verify_key_init.

   Let VERIFY_KEY_SIZE denote the length of the verification key for the
   VDAF indicated by the task configuration.  (See [VDAF], Section 5.)

   The VDAF verification key used for the task is computed as follows:

   verify_key = HKDF-Expand(
       HKDF-Extract(
           SHA-256("dap-taskprov"), # salt
           verify_key_init,         # IKM
       ),
       task_id,                     # info
       VERIFY_KEY_SIZE,             # L
   )

   where task_id is as defined in Section 3.  Functions HKDF-Extract()
   and HKDF-Expand() are as defined in [RFC5869].  Both functions are
   instantiated with SHA-256.

4.4.  Opting into a Task

   Prior to participating in a task, each protocol participant must
   determine if the TaskConfig disseminated by the Author can be
   configured.  The participant is said to "opt in" to the task if the
   derived task ID (see Section 3) corresponds to an already configured
   task or the task ID is unrecognized and therefore corresponds to a
   new task.

   A protocol participant MAY "opt out" of a task if:

   1.  The derived task ID corresponds to an already configured task,
       but the task configuration disseminated by the Author does not
       match the existing configuration.

   2.  The VDAF config or other parameters are deemed insufficient for
       privacy.

   3.  A secure connection to one or both of the Aggregator endpoints
       could not be established.

   4.  The task lifetime is too long.

   A protocol participant MUST opt out if:

   1.  The task has ended.

   2.  The DAP batch mode or VDAF is not implemented.

   3.  One of the extensions is not recognized.

   The behavior of each protocol participant is determined by whether or
   not they opt in to a task.

4.5.  Supporting HPKE Configurations Independent of Tasks

   In DAP, Clients need to know the HPKE configuration of each
   Aggregator before sending reports.  (See HPKE Configuration Request
   in [DAP].)  However, in a DAP deployment that supports the task
   provisioning mechanism described in this section, if a Client
   requests the Aggregator's HPKE configuration with the task ID
   computed as described in Section 3, the task ID may not be configured
   in the Aggregator yet, because the Aggregator is still waiting for
   the task to be advertised by a Client.

   To mitigate this issue, each Aggregator SHOULD choose which HPKE
   configuration to advertise to Clients independent of the task ID.  It
   MAY continue to support per-task HPKE configurations for other tasks
   that are configured out-of-band.

   In addition, if a Client intends to advertise a task via the Taskbind
   extension, it SHOULD NOT specify the task_id parameter when
   requesting the HPKE configuration from an Aggregator.

4.6.  Client Behavior

   Upon receiving a TaskConfig from the Author, the Client decides
   whether to opt into the task as described in Section 4.4.  If the
   Client opts out, it MUST not attempt to upload reports for the task.

   Once the client opts into a task, it may begin uploading reports for
   the task to the Leader.  The extension codepoint taskbind MUST be
   offered in the extensions field of both Leader and Helper's
   PlaintextInputShare.  In addition, each report's task ID MUST be
   computed as described in Section 3.

   The Client SHOULD advertise the task configuration by specifying the
   encoded TaskConfig described in Section 3 in the "dap-taskprov" HTTP
   header, but MAY choose to omit this header in order to save network
   bandwidth.  However, the Leader may respond with "unrecognizedTask"
   if it has not been configured with this task.  In this case, the
   Client MUST retry the upload request with the "dap-taskprov" HTTP
   header.

4.7.  Leader Behavior

4.7.1.  Upload Protocol

   Upon receiving a Client report, if the Leader does not support the
   Section 4 mechanism, it will ignore the "dap-taskprov" HTTP header.
   In particular, if the task ID is not recognized, then it MUST abort
   the upload request with "unrecognizedTask".

   Otherwise, if the Leader does support this mechanism, it first checks
   if the "dap-taskprov" HTTP header is specified.  If not, that means
   the Client has skipped task advertisement.  If the Leader recognizes
   the task ID, it will include the client report in the aggregation of
   that task ID.  Otherwise, it MUST abort with "unrecognizedTask".  The
   Client will then retry with the task advertisement.

   If the Client advertises the task, the Leader checks that the task ID
   indicated by the upload request matches the task ID derived from the
   "dap-taskprov" HTTP header as specified in Section 3.  If the task ID
   does not match, then the Leader MUST abort with "unrecognizedTask".

   The Leader then decides whether to opt in to the task as described in
   Section 4.4.  If it opts out, it MUST abort the upload request with
   "invalidTask".

   Finally, once the Leader has opted in to the task, it completes the
   upload request as usual.

   During the upload flow, if the Leader's report share does not present
   a taskbind extension type, Leader MUST abort the upload request with
   "invalidMessage".

4.7.2.  Aggregate Protocol

   When the Leader opts in to a task, it SHOULD derive the VDAF
   verification key for that task as described in Section 4.3.  The
   Leader MUST advertise the task to the Helper in every request
   incident to the task as described in Section 3.

4.7.3.  Collect Protocol

   The Collector might issue a collect request for a task provisioned by
   this mechanism prior to opting into the task.  In this case, the
   Leader would need to abort the collect request with
   "unrecognizedTask".  When it does so, it is up to the Collector to
   retry its request.

      OPEN ISSUE: This semantics is awkward, as there's no way for the
      Leader to distinguish between Collectors who support this
      mechanism and those that don't.

   The Leader MUST advertise the task in every aggregate share request
   issued to the Helper as described in Section 4.2.

4.8.  Helper Behavior

   Upon receiving a task advertisement from the Leader, If the Helper
   does not support this mechanism, it will ignore the "dap-taskprov"
   HTTP header and process the aggregate request as usual.  In
   particular, if the Helper does not recognize the task ID, it MUST
   abort the aggregate request with error "unrecognizedTask".
   Otherwise, if the Helper supports this mechanism, it proceeds as
   follows.

   First, the Helper attempts to parse payload of the "dap-taskprov"
   HTTP header.  If this step fails, the Helper MUST abort with
   "invalidMessage".

   Next, the Helper checks that the task ID indicated in the aggregation
   request matches the task ID derived from the TaskConfig as defined in
   Section 3.  If not, the Helper MUST abort with "unrecognizedTask".

   Next, the Helper decides whether to opt in to the task as described
   in Section 4.4.  If it opts out, it MUST abort the aggregation job
   request with "invalidTask".

   Finally, the Helper completes the request as usual, deriving the VDAF
   verification key for the task as described in Section 4.3.  For any
   report share that does not include the taskbind extension with an
   empty payload, the Helper MUST mark the report as invalid with error
   "invalid_message" and reject it.

4.9.  Collector Behavior

   Upon receiving a TaskConfig from the Author, the Collector first
   decides whether to opt into the task as described in Section 4.4.  If
   the Collector opts out, it MUST NOT attempt to issue collect requests
   for the task.

   Otherwise, once opted in, the Collector MAY begin to issue collect
   requests for the task.  The task ID for each request MUST be derived
   from the TaskConfig as described in Section 4.4.  The Collector MUST
   advertise the task as described in Section 3.

   If the Leader responds to a collect request with an
   "unrecognizedTask" error, the Collector MAY retry its collect request
   after waiting an appropriate amount of time.

5.  Security Considerations

   The Taskbind extension has the same security and privacy
   considerations as the core DAP protocol.  In addition, successful
   execution of a DAP task implies agreement on the task configuration.
   This is provided by binding the parameters to the task ID, which in
   turn is bound to each report uploaded for a task.  Furthermore,
   inclusion of the Taskbind extension in the report share means
   Aggregators that do not implement this extension will reject the
   report as required by (Section 4.5.1.4 of [DAP]).

   The task provisioning mechanism in Section 4 extends the threat model
   of DAP by including a new logical role, called the Author.  The
   Author is responsible for configuring Clients prior to task
   execution.  For privacy we consider the Author to be under control of
   the adversary.  It is therefore incumbent on protocol participants to
   verify the privacy parameters of a task before opting in.

   Another risk is that the Author could configure a unique task to
   fingerprint a Client.  Although Client anonymization is not
   guaranteed by DAP, some systems built on top of DAP may hope to
   achieve this property by using a proxy server with Oblivious HTTP
   [RFC9458] to forward Client reports to the Leader.  If the Author
   colludes with the Leader, the attacker can learn some metadata
   information about the Client, e.g., the Client IP, user agent string,
   which may deanonymize the Client.  However, even if the Author
   succeeds in doing so, the Author should learn nothing other than the
   fact that the Client has uploaded a report, assuming the Client has
   verified the privacy parameters of the task before opting into it.
   For example, if a task is uniquely configured for the Client, the
   Client can enforce the minimum batch size is strictly more than 1.

   Another risk for the Aggregators is that a malicious coalition of
   Clients might attempt to pollute an Aggregator's long-term storage by
   uploading reports for many (thousands or perhaps millions) of
   distinct tasks.  While this does not directly impact tasks used by
   honest Clients, it does present a Denial-of-Service risk for the
   Aggregators themselves.  This can be mitigated by limiting the rate
   at which new tasks are configured.  In addition, deployments SHOULD
   arrange for the Author to digitally sign the task configuration so
   that Clients cannot forge task creation.

6.  Operational Considerations

   The Taskbind extension does not introduce any new operational
   considerations for DAP.

   The task provisioning mechanism in Section 4 is designed so that the
   Aggregators do not need to store individual task configurations long-
   term.  Because the task configuration is advertised in each request
   in the upload, aggregation, and collection protocols, the process of
   opting-in and deriving the task ID and VDAF verify key can be re-run
   on the fly for each request.  This is useful if a large number of
   concurrent tasks are expected.  Once an Aggregator has opted-in to a
   task, the expectation is that the task is supported until it ends.
   In particular, Aggregators that operate in this manner MUST NOT opt
   out once they have opted in.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a codepoint for the taskbind report extension
   and for creation of a new registry for Taskbind extensions.

   (RFC EDITOR: Replace "XXXX" with the RFC number assigned to this
   document.)

7.1.  Report Extension

   The following entry will be (RFC EDITOR: change "will be" to "has
   been") added to the "Report Extension Identifiers" registry of the
   "Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP)" page created by [VDAF]:

   Value:  0xff00

   Name:  taskbind

   Reference:  RFC XXXX

7.2.  Registry for Taskbind Extensions

   A new registry will be (RFC EDITOR: change "will be" to "has been")
   created for the "Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP)" page called
   "Taskbind Extensions".  This registry contains the following columns:

   Value:  The two-byte identifier for the extension

   Name:  The name of the extension

   Reference:  Where the mechanism is defined

   The initial contents of this registry are listed in the following
   table.

              +========+==========+=========================+
              | Value  | Name     | Reference               |
              +========+==========+=========================+
              | 0x0000 | reserved | Section 3.2 of RFC XXXX |
              +--------+----------+-------------------------+

                 Table 2: Initial contents of the Taskbind
                            Extensions registry.

7.3.  DAP Sub-namespace for DAP

      TODO Figure out how to ask IANA to register the errors in Table 1.
      See https://github.com/ietf-wg-ppm/draft-ietf-ppm-dap-taskprov/
      issues/34

8.  Extending this Document

   The behavior of the taskbind extension may be extended by future
   documents that define:

   1.  A new DAP batch mode

   2.  A new VDAF

   3.  A new Taskbind extension

   Documents defining either a new DAP batch mode or VDAF SHOULD include
   a section titled "Taskbind Considerations" that specifies how to
   extend the BatchConfig structure and the VdafConfig structure
   respectively.

   Note that the registry for batch modes is defined by [DAP]; the
   registry for VDAFs is defined by [VDAF]; and the registry for
   Taskbind extensions is defined in Section 7.2 of this document.
